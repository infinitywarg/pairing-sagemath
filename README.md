## Groups, Rings and Fields <a name = "groups_rings_and_fields"></a>
**Groups**
Let G be a set together with a binary operation * that assigns each ordered pair (a,b) of elements of G another element in G denoted by a*b.
G is a group if it satisfies below three conditions:
1. Associativity: (a*b)*c = a*(b*c)
2. Identity: A special element e such that a*e = e*a = a
3. Inverses: Each element a has a unique inverse b such that a*b=e

If the set satisfies a fourth property of Commutativity, it's called a Commutative Group or an Abeian Group.
4. Commutativity: a*b = b*a

**Examples**
- Set of integers Z, set of rationals Q and set of real numbers R are all Abelian Groups under ordinary (arithmetic taught in schools) addition. In each case, identity is 0 and inverse of a is -a.
- Set of integers Z under ordinary multiplication is not a group, because each element does not have an inverse in the same set
